      "Adidas is a world-renowned brand. But by limiting itself to a website in many countries, it was not living up to its potential in terms of user acquisition. For a brand that is majorly driven by millennials, Adidas was keeping them deprived of having a convenient, hassle-free shopping experience on mobile.",
      "With mobile devices becoming the first point of purchase for users, being absent from creating a smartphone presence is something that businesses cannot afford. The same rule applied to Adidas too.",
      "It was time to expand the web-centric brand to mobile through a dedicated application."
