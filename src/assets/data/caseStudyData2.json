Using the right combination of font and image sizes, we were able to remove all elements of distraction from the pages, making the flow quick and easy. We also integrated various engaging features in Domino's pizza app such as sorting menus by categories, ordering food online, customizing orders, locating nearest store available for home delivery, making in-app payment, and tracking the Domino's delivery person in real-time."
